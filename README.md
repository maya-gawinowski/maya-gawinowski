## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
Currently open to new opportunities.
I combine my expertise in full-stack development (React, TypeScript, QML, C++) with a strong interest in UX/UI and user-centered design to craft meaningful digital experiences.

Past or current works you can find on my Github (non-exhaustive):
[Car Rental application]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/maya-gawinowski/car-rental)) (React Native)
Shared Money (JetPack Compose, Kotlin)
Learnify (Noesis GUI, Unity, openXR)

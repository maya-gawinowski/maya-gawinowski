## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently open to new opportunities.
I combine my expertise in full-stack development (React, TypeScript, QML, C++) with a strong interest in UX/UI and user-centered design to craft meaningful digital experiences.

Past or current works you can find on my Github (non-exhaustive):
- [Car Rental application](https://github.com/maya-gawinowski/car-rental) (React Native)
- [Shared Money](https://github.com/maya-gawinowski/sharedexpenses-app) (JetPack Compose, Kotlin)
- [Learnify](https://gitlab.com/GuillaumeVDN/projet-learnify) (Noesis GUI, Unity, openXR)
- [DroneIT](https://github.com/maya-gawinowski/DroneIT) (python, drone Parrot)
